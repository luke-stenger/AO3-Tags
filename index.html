        <h2>Welcome!</h2>
        <p>Prepare to embark on a wonderful journey of male/male fiction! Building off of <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kcm4TRtMFFCo2oYXR508TkrwdTTE1WtR8JlE9VvFHQ8" target="_blank">our class's collaborative definition of BL</a>, this websites aims to quantitatively measure which story elements are more associated with male/male (M/M) stories. We do this by analyzing data from the online fanfiction repository Archive of Our Own (AO3). Please navigate by clicking on the links in the gray bar above this paragraph.</p>
        <p>In <a href="background.html">Background</a>, you will learn a little bit about the design of the AO3 website, and why it is such a M/M haven. In <a href="goals.html">Goals / Procedere</a>, you'll hear about exactly how we can use AO3's data to find connections between M/M stories and certain tropes. The most interesting page is <a href="results.html">Results</a>: you'll get to see exactly which elements are disproportionately common in M/M stories. Finally, in <a href="conclusion.html">Conclusions</a> you'll hear about the limitations of this analysis, but why it is ultimately valuable for studying genres like BL.</p>
