        <h1>The Design of AO3</h1>
        <p>The Archive of Our Own website describes itself as “A fan-created, fan-run, nonprofit, noncommercial archive for transformative fanworks, like fanfiction, fanart, fan videos, and podfic.” However, due in part to the site’s lack of infrastructure for embedding images or audio, AO3 is overwhelmingly used to host purely textual fanfiction. This puts it among the ranks of other popular fanfiction repositories including FanFiction.Net and Wattpad. However, AO3 has several distinguishing qualities that set it apart from other fanfiction websites, and contribute to its <a href="https://www.tumblr.com/destinationtoast/52261319793/next-up-in-my-ongoing-series-on-ao3-stats-a" target="_blank">particularly high concentration of male/male stories</a>.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section id="inclusiveness">
        <h2>Content Inclusiveness</h2>
        <p>AO3 lists one of its goals as “maximum inclusiveness of fanwork content.” The site has extremely lenient content policies compared to other fiction hosting sites, and generally only removes stories under very extreme circumstances. This is in direct contrast to FanFiction.Net and Wattpad, which both have extensive and stringently enforced content policies. FanFiction.Net in particular has a history of changing its content policy and banning swaths of its stories and users without warning. AO3 was partially founded as a more stable alternative to these less stable sites (Black 2021).</p>
        <p>This inclusivity also likely contributes to the prevalence of M/M stories on AO3. Historically, works with LGBTQ elements have been more likely to be reported online for explicit or inappropriate content than comparable stories involving straight romances. By doing away with this kind of moderation entirely, AO3 eliminates the possibility of the biasies administrators or readers affecting which content is allowed on the site.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="noncommercialism">
        <h2>Non Commercialism</h2>
        <p>AO3 is the only major fanfiction hosting site that is not for profit. It survives mostly off donations and the work of many online volunteers, and as such has no need for advertisements or a subscription system. Additionally, AO3 is unique among hosting sites in that it was developed and maintained entirely by members of the community which it serves (Fiesler et al., 2016). Because AO3’s developers have been in the m/m fiction community since the beginning, the site has naturally been designed to accommodate that type of story.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="tagging">
        <h2>Tagging System</h2>
        <p>AO3 is perhaps best known for its sophisticated behemoth of a tagging system. In interviews conducted by Fiesler et al. (2016), the vast majority of developers and users identified AO3’s tagging system as key to its success. In addition to standard tags such as fandom and rating, AO3 allows writers to tag their stories with a large number of freeform tags, which can reference any element of the fic’s plot, relationships, and themes. These freeform tags are written by fic authors, and thus give rise to a user-controlled <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folksonomy" target="_blank">folksonomy</a>. Afterwards, AO3’s volunteer team of “tag wranglers” group synonymous tags together to improve searching and filtering.</p>
        <p>We can see how this seemingly chaotic system leads to an effective tagging scheme. As stories are added to the site, tags are added to meet the needs of the authors. Tag wranglers keep the system coherent, and eventually certain tags become so prolific that they become a practically canonical element of the folksonomy. As Golder & Huberman (2005) note, this sort of “flat” tagging system is more inclusive and promotes more diversity than a taxonomical hierarchy imposed from the top down (e.g. the Dewey Decimal System).</p>
        <p>Fathallah (2018) also describes how AO3’s uniquely robust tagging scheme affects the way users interact with fiction. While other fiction hosting sites stress user interaction at the level of the story (i.e. commenting, liking), AO3 stresses user interaction at the level of the archive (i.e. searching through tags). This leads to an even wider diversity of stories, since a fic’s uniqueness or niche-appeal can often matter more than its quality.</p>
        <p>Finally, AO3’s extensive tagging system makes it an excellent candidate for analyzing story elements in online fiction, as I hope to do in the following pages. You can now continue to <a href="goals.html">Goals / Procedere</a>.</p>
