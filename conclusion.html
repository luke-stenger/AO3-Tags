        <h2>Limitations</h2>
        <p>It must be stated that this analysis is extremely limited in the conclusions it can support, for a variety of reasons. Most obviously, the dataset used is severly limited in scope. It covers only a 13 year period, and stops at the year 2021. Additionally, the works hosted on AO3, while numerous, are still only a tiny portion of the wider fan work community. AO3 itself is biased in many ways that make it difficult for us to extrapolate too much from its data. Its preference for certain genres and fandoms likely biased our data. As an example, the M/M correlation for the "Sibling Incest" tag was likely biased upward due to the particular prevelance of Supernatural fics on the site.</p>
        <p>We face even even greater issues when trying to apply this data to the genre of BL, as I did in the results section. AO3 was founded and is based in America, and is much more aligned with the genre of slash than with boys love. Thus, it's possibly that the tropes AO3 writers associate with M/M romance is wildly different from the tropes BL writers associate with M/M romance.</p>

    <section id="conclusion">
        <h2>Comclusion</h2>
        <p>Dispite these many limitations, I still argue that this analysis is valuable in understanding M/M romance fiction. Much of our class time in COMP 228 was spent discussing which plot points, cliches, and story element are particularly characteristic of the BL genre. Some even say that particular story elements are what <i>define</i> the genre. However, without a quantitative element to our discussion, it is extremely difficult make these kinds of conclusions. It's tricky to figure out whether any one trope is characteristic of the genre of BL or of Asian romance media in general, especially when we are not very familar with Asian media.</p>
        <p>The analysis shown on this site demonstrates a novel way to investigate the characteristics of female-authored M/M fiction. This method can't copletely prove or debunk the validity any BL trope, but it can bring forward new tropes that we hadn't thought of, or call into question tropes that we thought were characteristic of the BL genre. If nothing else, this analysis made me consider whether villianized female characters were actually more common in M/M romance stories than in any other romance story.</p>
        <p>AO3 was a great source to begin this analysis, but in the future it would be wonderful to expand to a wider range of online stories. If a method can be found to extract data from other fiction sites, including ones more focused on media from Asia, then we might be able to draw firmer conclusions about what actually distiguishes BL from other genres. In the meantime, keep enjoying the internet's broad selection of M/M fiction!</p>
